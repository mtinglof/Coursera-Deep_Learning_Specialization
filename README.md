# Coursera-Deep_Learning_Specialization

This repository contains the code developed to complete coursework assignments during the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. The coursework was part of a program designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of deep learning techniques and their applications.

## Specialization Overview

The Deep Learning Specialization, offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera, consists of the following five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5. **Sequence Models**

The specialization was primarily instructed by Andrew Ng, the founder of DeepLearning.AI, and is designed to help learners build a solid foundation in deep learning concepts.
